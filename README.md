# gene-trajectory-experiments

This is a personal experiment version of [KlugerLab/GeneTrajectory-python](https://github.com/KlugerLab/GeneTrajectory-python), which models state transitions in gene experssion using optimal transport and dimensionality reduction techniques.

Iâ€™m using this repo to:

- Understand how the method works
- Run experiments
- Possibly try out small modifications

Experiments are organized into Google Colab notebooks.

## Original Repository

Please refer to the official version here:  
- [KlugerLab/GeneTrajectory-python/geneTrajectory](https://github.com/KlugerLab/GeneTrajectory-python)

## Original Paper

The method is described in detail in the article [
Gene trajectory inference for single-cell data by optimal transport metrics](
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-024-02186-3).
